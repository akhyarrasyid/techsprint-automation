# Power Load Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based power load classification system that predicts electrical load types based on power consumption patterns. The system analyzes electrical grid data to classify loads into three categories: Light Load, Medium Load, and Maximum Load.

## Dataset

The dataset contains power consumption data from 2018 with measurements collected every 15 minutes, resulting in 96 readings per day and over 35,000 total records. 

### Key Features:
- **Date_Time**: Timestamp of the measurement
- **Usage_kWh**: Power consumption in kilowatt-hours
- **Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh**: Reactive power (lagging)
- **Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh**: Reactive power (leading)
- **CO2(tCO2)**: Carbon dioxide emissions
- **Lagging_Current_Power_Factor**: Power factor (lagging current)
- **Leading_Current_Power_Factor**: Power factor (leading current)
- **Load_Type**: Target variable (Light_Load, Medium_Load, Maximum_Load)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Time Feature Engineering**: Extracted temporal features (hour, day, month, weekday)
- **Cyclical Features**: Created sinusoidal transformations for temporal patterns
- **Holiday Detection**: Incorporated holiday information for better seasonality modeling
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Used monthly and load-type-specific means for imputation
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features like total reactive power, power factor differences, and usage ratios

### 2. Model Development
Three state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated:

- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Ensemble method with boosting
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Optimized gradient boosting with advanced regularization
- **LightGBM Classifier**: Fast gradient boosting with optimal performance

### 3. Model Performance
The models achieved excellent performance metrics:

- **Best Model**: LightGBM Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **F1 Score**: 0.91 macro-F1
- **Training Period**: January-November 2018
- **Testing Period**: December 2018

## Key Achievements

✅ **High Accuracy**: Achieved 92% classification accuracy across three load types  
✅ **Robust Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive temporal and domain-specific features  
✅ **Model Comparison**: Systematic evaluation of multiple ML algorithms  
✅ **Real-world Application**: 15-minute interval predictions for grid management  
✅ **Deployment Success**: Built and deployed a load forecasting ML model achieving 92% accuracy and 0.91 macro-F1 on real-world energy datasets  
✅ **API Optimization**: Engineered an async FastAPI inference API with ORJSON and caching, sustaining 430 RPS throughput under 500 concurrent users  
✅ **Latency Improvement**: Reduced 95th percentile latency from 3000 ms to 1100 ms (2.7× faster) via multi-worker scaling and optimized serialization  
✅ **Core Prediction Speed**: Optimized FastAPI inference pipeline to deliver <1 ms core prediction latency with 430 RPS throughput under 500 concurrent users  

## Business Impact

This power load forecasting system provides significant value for:

- **Grid Operators**: Better load planning and resource allocation
- **Energy Companies**: Improved demand forecasting and pricing strategies
- **Sustainability**: Optimized energy distribution reducing waste
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Data-driven decisions for grid expansion

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
cd backend
# Backend dependencies in /backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn orjson pickle5 scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm
# or
uv sync

# Frontend dependencies in /frontend
cd frontend
npm install next react react-dom recharts lucide-react
```

### Launch the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 4
```

### Launch the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

### Run with Docker Compose (production-like)

Build and run both services (backend + frontend) together with Docker Compose. From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the backend from `./backend` and expose it on localhost:8080
- Build the frontend from `./frontend` and expose it on localhost:3000

If you want to change the default model used by the backend, set the `MODEL_NAME` environment variable for the `backend` service in `docker-compose.yml` (default: `lgbm`).
